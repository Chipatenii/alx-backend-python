# 0x02-python_async_comprehension

Welcome to the `0x02-python_async_comprehension` repository! This project covers advanced asynchronous programming concepts in Python, including asynchronous generators, async comprehensions, and type annotations for generators.

## Writing an Asynchronous Generator

Asynchronous generators are a powerful feature in Python that allows you to yield values asynchronously. They are defined using the `async def` syntax and the `yield` keyword.

Example:
```python
import asyncio
import random

async def async_generator():
    for _ in range(10):
        await asyncio.sleep(1)
        yield random.random()
```

In this example, `async_generator` yields random numbers asynchronously, simulating a delay between each value.

## Using Async Comprehensions

Async comprehensions allow you to consume asynchronous iterators in a concise and efficient way. They are similar to regular comprehensions but work with asynchronous generators.

Example:
```python
async def async_comprehension():
    result = [i async for i in async_generator()]
    return result
```

In this example, `async_comprehension` collects all the values yielded by `async_generator` into a list.

## Type-Annotating Generators

Type annotations in Python help to improve code readability and provide hints about the expected types. For asynchronous generators, you can use `AsyncGenerator` from the `typing` module.

Example:
```python
from typing import AsyncGenerator

async def async_generator() -> AsyncGenerator[float, None]:
    for _ in range(10):
        await asyncio.sleep(1)
        yield random.random()
```

In this example, the function `async_generator` is annotated to indicate that it returns an `AsyncGenerator` that yields `float` values and does not send any values back.

## How to Run the Code

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Chipatenii/0x02-python_async_comprehension.git
   cd 0x02-python_async_comprehension
   ```

2. Run the Python scripts:
   ```bash
   python script_name.py
   ```

3. Ensure you have Python 3.7+ installed to fully utilize the async features.
