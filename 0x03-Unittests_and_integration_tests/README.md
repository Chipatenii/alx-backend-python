# 0x03-Unittests_and_integration_tests

## Overview

This repository focuses on two essential testing methodologies in software development: **Unit Testing** and **Integration Testing**. Understanding the difference between these two types of tests and how to effectively implement them is crucial for ensuring the reliability and quality of your code.

### Unit Testing
Unit testing involves verifying that a particular function returns the expected results for a variety of input cases, including standard inputs and edge cases. The primary focus is on testing the logic defined within the function itself, isolating it from external dependencies by mocking calls to additional functions, especially those that involve network or database operations.

**The goal of a unit test is to answer the question: If everything defined outside this function works as expected, does this function work as expected?**

### Integration Testing
Integration testing, on the other hand, aims to test a code path end-to-end. This involves testing the interactions between different parts of your code to ensure they work together as expected. While low-level functions that make external calls (e.g., HTTP requests, file I/O, database I/O) are often mocked, the overall interactions between components are the focus.

**The goal of an integration test is to ensure that different parts of the codebase interact seamlessly.**

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the difference between unit and integration tests.
- Learn common testing patterns such as mocking, parameterization, and fixtures.

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Chipatenii/0x03-Unittests_and_integration_tests.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd 0x03-Unittests_and_integration_tests
    ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Running Tests
- **Unit Tests**:
    ```bash
    pytest tests/test_unit/
    ```
- **Integration Tests**:
    ```bash
    pytest tests/test_integration/
    ```
